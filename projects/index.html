    <h4>Phoenix: A Fault-Tolerant Sharded Key-Value Store</h4>
    <p class="duration">Go · gRPC</p>
  </div>
  <p class="description">
    Phoenix is a networked distributed key-value store built using Go and gRPC
    that provides linearizable semantics. Phoenix is built from the ground up,
    implementing the Raft consensus protocol (leader election, logging, snapshots,
    log compaction) within replication groups, duplicate request detection, and
    shard coordination, and shard reconfiguration.

    <h4>PHOSS: A Distributed Hyperparameter Optimization Search Simulator</h4>
    <p class="duration">Python · PyTorch · Ray</p>
  </div>
  <p class="description">
    PHOSS is a platform for conducting fast and robust HPO scheduler experiments
    using synthetic landscapes. PHOSS can simulate running schedulers on
    real-life data using a smaller number of samples to create a large amount of
    synthetic data. At its core, PHOSS is a computationally efficient and
    expressive exponential decay parametric modeling approach to accurately
    simulate loss landscapes from real-world datasets for fast HPO scheduler
    experimentation.

  </div>
  <p class="description">
    RayICV is an internal cross-validation solution for the Ray open-source
    unified compute framework library that supports hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, it
    extends the Ray Train framework by implementing built-in cross-validation in
    order to emulate the scheduling of jobs based on folds trained and model
    configuration.

    ShuttleDB is a column-oriented NoSQL database that can efficiently handle
    10M+ tuples per column with support for selecting, fetching, joining,
    loading, column arithmetic, and multiple aggregation types. ShuttleDB has
    built-in modules such as the parser, query optimizer, and catalog, as well
    as advanced optimizations to minimize IO costs such as primary and secondary
    indexing with B-trees, custom TCP streaming protocols for large payloads,
    zone maps, hash joins, and multithreaded shared scans.

  <p class="description">
    Spotify Curator is a full-stack web application leveraging machine learning
    to help users discover new songs they love. Spotify Curator calls the
    Spotify API to securely authenticate users and store their liked songs'
    attributes as training data. It then performs k-means clustering to
    determine the probability that the user will like any new song or playlist.
    Model training and predictions are stored in a distributed task queue and
    picked up asynchronously by Celery workers. Redis serves as both a message
    broker and result store for the queue.
