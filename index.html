<h3>üëãüèª Hi, I'm Sai!</h3>
<p>
  I'm a rising senior studying computer science at Harvard University and am
  interested in distributed systems, databases, and systems for machine learning.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently interning at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> on the
  Fleet Automation team, working on distributed caching. In previous summers,
  I've worked at <a href="https://about.facebook.com/meta">Meta</a>, primarily
  on the backend for avatar sticker categories in the Facebook news feed, and at
  <a href="https://www.li.me">Lime</a>, working on deep integrations with
  third-party transit providers. Prior to that, I took a year off between my
  first and second year of college to work at
  <a href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a> on internal tooling and data
  pipelines for the WebEx media engine.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  I recently interned at <a href="https://about.facebook.com/meta">Meta</a> on
  the Facebook Avatars team, working on the backend for sticker categories in
  the Facebook news feed. I've also previously interned at
  <a href="https://www.li.me">Lime</a> for a summer, working on deep
  integrations with third-party transit providers; and at
  <a href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a> for a year, working on internal
  tooling and data pipelines for the Webex media engine.

<p>
  On campus, I'm a research assistant for Dr. Stratos Idreos in the
  <a href="http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/">Data Systems Lab</a>, working on
  projects related to self-designing data systems and systems for machine learning.
  I'm also a research assistant for Dr. Eddie Kohler, working on projects related to
  highly-parallel multicore databases and serverless systems. I also help write
  the scoring and matching algorithms for
  <a href="https://datamatch.me/">Datamatch</a>, a matchmaking service started
  at Harvard that has since expanded to over 40 schools.
</p>

<p>
  Some of my friends think I'm a giant nerd, which is accurate. However, I also
  enjoy playing tennis and ice hockey, trying new foods, and may even <em>try</em>
  to dance in rare occasions.
